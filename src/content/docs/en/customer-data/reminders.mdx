The Reminders tab in the Aadvanto Billing System is designed to help manage unpaid invoices by sending notifications to customers. The system supports two levels of reminders: Payment Reminder (Level 1) and Final Reminder (Level 2). Each level has a specific purpose and action associated with it to ensure timely payment of dues.

### Reminder Levels

#### Level 1: Payment Reminder (Zahlungserinnerung)

The Payment Reminder, or "Zahlungserinnerung," is the first level of notification sent to customers who have overdue invoices. This reminder serves as a gentle nudge to the customer to settle their outstanding payments. Below is a detailed explanation of this reminder level:

1. **Purpose**: To inform the customer about the overdue payment and request immediate settlement.
2. **Content**: Includes the invoice number, the due date, the outstanding amount, and a polite request for payment.
3. **Action**: Customers are expected to make the payment by the new specified date to avoid further reminders.

**Example of Payment Reminder:**

#### Level 2: Final Reminder (Letzte Mahnung)

The Final Reminder, or "Letzte Mahnung," is the second level of notification sent to customers who have ignored the initial payment reminder. This reminder indicates a more urgent need for payment and includes potential consequences of non-payment. Below is a detailed explanation of this reminder level:

1. **Purpose**: To inform the customer about the overdue payment with a more urgent tone and warn of further actions if payment is not received.
2. **Content**: Includes the invoice number, the due date, the outstanding amount, any additional fees (e.g., late fees), and a final request for payment.
3. **Action**: Customers are given a final deadline to make the payment. Failure to comply may result in further action, such as involvement of a collection agency.

**Example of Final Reminder:**

### Understanding the Reminder Levels

Both levels of reminders serve crucial roles in the payment collection process:

- **Payment Reminder**: A gentle prompt reminding the customer of an overdue invoice, with a request for payment within a short grace period.
- **Final Reminder**: A more serious notification that emphasizes the urgency of payment and warns of potential consequences, such as the involvement of a collection agency.

By understanding and utilizing these reminder levels effectively, you can ensure timely payments and maintain good customer relationships.
